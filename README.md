# Computer-Architecture-PA-3

**This was the third project assigned in Rutgers 01:198:211 (Computer Architecture).

In this project, I learned about how data is represented in computers, as well as the properties and limitations of data types. I also experimented with how computers carry out mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on the data representations. Below you can find a description of each folder of the programming assignment.

- toHex: Converting signed integers to binary and hexadecimal representation
  - Takes positive and negative integers that can be represented using signed short (16-bit) integer data types and prints out their hexadecimal representation.
- binSub: Finding the difference of two signed integers via operations on binary numbers
  - Performs subtraction on signed char (8-bit) integers, where positive and negative numbers are encoded in the two's complement number system.
- binToFloat: Finding the value of a floating point number binary representation
  - Decodes the 32-bit binary representation of an IEEE 754 single-precision floating point number.
- doubleToBin: Find the binary representation of a double-precision floating point number
  - Encodes a given real number as an IEEE 754 double-precision floating point number, and prints out its 64-bit binary bitstream.
- floatMul: Finding the product of two-single precision floating numbers via operations in binary
  - Implements floating point multiplication
